                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Elyphant was born from a simple observation: despite our best intentions, 
                    we often forget or miss opportunities to show our loved ones we care through 
                    timely, thoughtful gifts.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Our founders share a deep passion for strengthening connections between people. 
                    They envisioned a platform that would not only remind you of important occasions but
                    take care of the entire gifting process with the same care and attention you would.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Today, Elyphant has grown into a comprehensive gifting platform that helps thousands 
                    of people maintain and nurture their most important relationships through thoughtful, 
                    automated gifting.

                    our busy lives. Our mission is to ensure that no important moment goes uncelebrated 
                    and no relationship suffers from neglect.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    With our patented automated gifting technology, we've revolutionized how people 
                    maintain connections. Our platform remembers important dates, analyzes preferences, 
                    and delivers perfectly timed gifts that feel personal and thoughtful.

                    <strong>$890 billion</strong> - That's how much merchandise was returned in the US retail market in 2024,

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Traditional gifting often results in unwanted items that end up returned or, worse, 
                      discarded. The average return rate for gifts is significantly higher than regular purchases, 
                      contributing to massive environmental waste and retailer losses.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Many returned items cannot be resold and end up in landfills, creating unnecessary 
                      environmental impact from production, shipping, and disposal.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      Elyphant's custom wishlist feature allows recipients to "get the gift they want" by 
                      curating personalized lists of desired items. Gift-givers can choose from these 
                      pre-approved options, dramatically reducing the likelihood of returns.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      By matching gifts to genuine preferences, we help ensure every present is meaningful, 
                      wanted, and keeps families and friends connected rather than creating waste.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    Our name and logo were inspired by elephants because they embody the very qualities 
                    we strive to bring to gifting. Elephants are renowned for their remarkable memory, 
                    deep emotional intelligence, and strong family bonds. They're naturally thoughtful, 
                    compassionate, and celebrate their connections through rituals and gatherings.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    Like these magnificent creatures, Elyphant remembers what matters, responds with 
                    emotional intelligence, and helps strengthen the bonds between people through 
                    meaningful gestures. We aspire to bring the same level of care, intelligence, and 
                    connection to your gifting experience.
