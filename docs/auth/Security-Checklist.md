# UnifiedAuthService Security Checklist

## Pre-Implementation Security Review

### Input Validation
- [ ] Email format validation implemented
- [ ] Password strength requirements enforced
- [ ] Input sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures
- [ ] XSS attack protection
- [ ] Path traversal attack detection

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Rate limits defined for password reset attempts
- [ ] Integration with existing rate limiting infrastructure
- [ ] Proper error handling for rate limit violations
- [ ] User-friendly messages for rate limited requests

### Token Security
- [ ] Secure token storage (session storage, not URL)
- [ ] Token expiration properly implemented
- [ ] One-time use enforcement
- [ ] Token cleanup after use
- [ ] Proper token validation caching

### Audit Logging
- [ ] All authentication events logged
- [ ] Proper risk level classification
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Log retention policy defined
- [ ] Log access controls implemented

## Post-Implementation Security Verification

### Functional Security Tests
- [ ] Password reset flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Invalid tokens properly rejected
- [ ] Expired tokens automatically cleaned up
- [ ] Rate limiting activates correctly
- [ ] Suspicious activity detection works

### Integration Security Tests
- [ ] Existing auth infrastructure unaffected
- [ ] No data leakage between services
- [ ] Cache isolation properly implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose internals

### Performance Security Tests
- [ ] No memory leaks in cache management
- [ ] DoS attack resistance tested
- [ ] Database query performance acceptable
- [ ] Cache cleanup runs automatically

## Ongoing Security Monitoring

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Review security event logs
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting activity
- [ ] Check for failed authentication spikes
- [ ] Verify cache performance metrics

### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Analyze suspicious activity patterns
- [ ] Review error rates and types
- [ ] Check token validation performance
- [ ] Verify cleanup procedures running

### Monthly Audits
- [ ] Full security log analysis
- [ ] Rate limiting threshold review
- [ ] Cache strategy effectiveness
- [ ] Incident response plan testing

## Security Incident Response

### Detection
- [ ] Automated alerts for critical events
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard configured
- [ ] Escalation procedures defined
- [ ] Response team identified

### Response
- [ ] Immediate isolation procedures
- [ ] Evidence collection protocols
- [ ] User notification requirements
- [ ] Recovery procedures tested

### Recovery
- [ ] Service restoration checklist
- [ ] Security patch deployment
- [ ] Post-incident review process
- [ ] Lessons learned documentation
