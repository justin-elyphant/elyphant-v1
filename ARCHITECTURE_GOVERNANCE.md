# 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE GOVERNANCE
## Unified Systems Governance & Compliance Framework

This document establishes governance rules and compliance frameworks for maintaining the unified systems architecture.

---

## 🎯 GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Single Source of Truth
Each domain has exactly one authoritative service:
- **Products**: UnifiedMarketplaceService
- **Payments/Cart**: UnifiedPaymentService  
- **Amazon Business**: Enhanced Zinc API System
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database**: Supabase with RLS

### Principle 2: Service Hierarchy Compliance
```
Frontend Components
    ↓
Unified Services Layer
    ↓  
Edge Functions (External APIs)
    ↓
External Services (Stripe, Zinc, etc.)
```

### Principle 3: Protection-First Development
All changes must:
1. Respect existing protection boundaries
2. Maintain service integration points
3. Preserve dual payment architecture
4. Follow established patterns

---

## 📋 COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

### Level 1: Automated Compliance (Build-Time)
```typescript
// ESLint rules (to be implemented in future CLI)
"no-direct-api-calls": "error",
"enforce-service-hierarchy": "error", 
"no-service-bypass": "error",
"payment-architecture-separation": "error"
```

### Level 2: Code Review Compliance
Required checks for all PRs:
- [ ] **Service Boundaries**: No service bypassing detected
- [ ] **API Access**: All external APIs through Edge Functions
- [ ] **Payment Separation**: Customer/business flows separate
- [ ] **Protection Docs**: Updated if architecture changes
- [ ] **Decision Trees**: Used for implementation decisions
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Service coordination verified

### Level 3: Runtime Compliance
Monitoring and alerts for:
- Direct API calls from frontend
- Service hierarchy violations
- Protection boundary violations
- Performance degradation from poor integration

## 🛡️ PROTECTION COMPLIANCE MATRIX

| Aspect | UnifiedMarketplace | UnifiedPayment | Enhanced Zinc API |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Product Operations** | ✅ OWNS | ❌ MUST CALL | ❌ INTERNAL ONLY |
| **Cart Management** | ❌ FORBIDDEN | ✅ OWNS | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Customer Payments** | ❌ FORBIDDEN | ✅ OWNS | ❌ FORBIDDEN |
| **Amazon Orders** | ❌ MUST DELEGATE | ✅ ROUTES TO | ✅ OWNS |
| **Direct API Calls** | ❌ FORBIDDEN | ❌ FORBIDDEN | ✅ EDGE FUNCTIONS ONLY |

### Compliance Rules:
- ✅ **OWNS**: Service has full authority and responsibility
- ✅ **ROUTES TO**: Service coordinates but delegates
- ❌ **MUST CALL**: Service must use another service
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Service cannot perform this operation
- ❌ **INTERNAL ONLY**: Service only accessible via designated interfaces

## 🔍 ARCHITECTURE REVIEW PROCESS

### For New Features:
1. **Pre-Development Review**:
   - Use decision trees to determine service ownership
   - Check protection boundaries for compliance
   - Plan service integration points
   - Document any new coordination requirements

2. **Implementation Review**:
   - Verify service hierarchy followed
   - Check no protection violations
   - Validate integration patterns
   - Test service coordination

3. **Pre-Production Review**:
   - End-to-end integration testing
   - Performance impact assessment
   - Security boundary validation
   - Documentation updates verified

### For Service Changes:
1. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Identify all dependent services
   - Check integration points affected
   - Assess protection boundary changes
   - Plan coordination updates

2. **Implementation Governance**:
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Update service interfaces carefully
   - Test all integration points
   - Update protection documentation

3. **Rollout Governance**:
   - Gradual feature rollout
   - Monitor service health
   - Watch for integration issues
   - Be prepared to rollback

- Customer/business payment mixing

#### High (P1) - Fix Within 24 Hours:
- UnifiedMarketplaceService bypass for products
- Edge Function bypass for external APIs  
- Protection boundary violations
- Service integration breakage

#### Medium (P2) - Fix Within Week:
- Performance degradation from poor integration
- Documentation out of sync
- Inconsistent error handling
- Missing integration tests

#### Low (P3) - Fix Next Sprint:
- Code style violations
- Missing documentation
- Optimization opportunities
- Technical debt
