## 🔄 COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION TESTS

### Test Suite B: End-to-End Workflows (15 minutes)

#### Test B1: Complete Purchase Flow
```javascript
// Amazon Product Purchase Test
1. Search for Amazon product (identifiable by vendor)
2. Add to cart with quantity 2
3. Navigate to checkout
4. Fill shipping information
5. Proceed to payment (test mode)
6. Verify order creation
7. Confirm Zinc processing initiated

// Expected Results:
- ✅ Product loads from UnifiedMarketplaceService
- ✅ Cart updates via UnifiedPaymentService  
- ✅ Amazon order routes to process-zinc-order Edge Function
- ✅ Order created with correct details
```

#### Test B2: Multi-Product Cart Management
```javascript
// Complex Cart Operations Test
1. Add 3 different products to cart
2. Update quantity of second item
3. Remove first item
4. Add another item
5. Assign different recipients to items
6. Create delivery groups
7. Clear cart completely

// Expected Results:
- ✅ All operations work identically to original CartContext
- ✅ Cart state persists correctly
- ✅ Recipient assignments maintained
- ✅ No UI glitches or state inconsistencies
```

#### Test B3: Guest vs Authenticated User Flow
```javascript
// Guest Cart Transfer Test
1. As guest: Add items to cart
2. Navigate around site (verify cart persists)
3. Sign in/register
4. Verify guest cart merges with user cart
5. Complete purchase as authenticated user

// Expected Results:
- ✅ Guest cart persists in localStorage
- ✅ Cart transfer works seamlessly on login
- ✅ No duplicate items created during merge
- ✅ All cart operations work for both user types
```

## 🛡️ PROTECTION BOUNDARY VALIDATION

### Test Suite C: Architecture Compliance (10 minutes)

#### Test C1: Service Integration Verification
```javascript
// Verify Service Call Hierarchy
1. Open browser dev tools → Network tab
2. Perform cart operations (add, remove, update)
3. Search for products
4. Process payment

// Validation Points:
- ✅ No direct calls to zinc.io domain
- ✅ No direct calls to stripe.com from frontend
- ✅ All external API calls go through Edge Functions
- ✅ Product operations call UnifiedMarketplaceService
```

#### Test C2: Payment Architecture Separation
```javascript
// Verify Dual Payment Architecture
1. Add Amazon product to cart
2. Add non-Amazon product to cart  
3. Process payment
4. Monitor Edge Function logs

// Validation Points:
- ✅ Customer payment processes through Stripe
- ✅ Amazon fulfillment routes through Zinc Edge Functions
- ✅ No mixing of payment methods
- ✅ Business credentials never exposed to frontend
```

## 📱 MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS TESTS

### Test Suite D: Mobile Experience (10 minutes)

#### Test D1: Mobile Cart Operations
```javascript
// Mobile Device Testing (Chrome DevTools Mobile View)
1. Set viewport to iPhone 12 Pro
2. Navigate to marketplace
3. Search and add products to cart
4. Navigate to cart page
5. Update quantities using mobile UI
6. Assign recipients using mobile interface
7. Complete checkout flow

// Validation Points:
- ✅ All buttons properly sized for touch
- ✅ Cart operations work with touch gestures
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ No horizontal scrolling issues
- ✅ Loading states display correctly on mobile
```

#### Test D2: Cross-Device Consistency
```javascript
// Multi-Device Cart Sync Test
1. Start cart on desktop (add items)
2. Switch to mobile device
3. Verify cart state synchronized
4. Add items on mobile
5. Return to desktop
6. Verify all changes persisted

// Validation Points:
- ✅ Cart state syncs across devices (same user)
- ✅ Local storage persistence works
- ✅ No data loss during device switches
```

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE VALIDATION TESTS

### Test Suite E: Performance Benchmarks (15 minutes)

#### Test E1: Cart Performance Measurement
```javascript
// Cart Operation Timing
const measureCartOperation = (operation) => {
  const start = performance.now();
  // Perform cart operation
  const end = performance.now();
  console.log(`${operation} took ${end - start} milliseconds`);
};

// Test Operations:
1. Add item to cart (should be < 100ms)
2. Update quantity (should be < 50ms)
3. Remove item (should be < 50ms)
4. Load cart page (should be < 500ms)
5. Clear cart (should be < 100ms)

// Baseline Comparison:
// Compare with original CartContext timings
// Expect 20%+ improvement in most operations
```

#### Test E2: Integration Performance
```javascript
// Service Integration Timing
1. Measure product search response time
2. Measure cart-to-checkout navigation time
3. Measure payment processing initiation time
4. Measure order creation time

// Performance Targets:
- Product search: < 3 seconds
- Cart operations: < 100ms
- Checkout navigation: < 500ms  
- Payment initiation: < 2 seconds
```

// Edge Function Failure Test  
1. Navigate to Supabase Edge Functions dashboard
2. Temporarily disable process-zinc-order function
3. Try to process Amazon order
4. Verify graceful error handling
5. Re-enable function and test recovery
```

#### Test F2: Data Consistency Validation
```javascript

  test('adds product to cart via service', async () => {
    const result = await unifiedPaymentService.addToCart('product-123', 2);
    expect(result).toBeTruthy();
    expect(unifiedPaymentService.getItemCount()).toBe(2);
  });
  
  test('routes Amazon orders through Edge Functions', async () => {
    // Mock and verify Edge Function calls
  });
});
