# üö® CHECKOUT SYSTEM RESTORATION GUIDE üö®

## Critical System Overview

This checkout system is a sophisticated, multi-component integration that handles:
- Complex payment processing with Stripe
- Order creation with multiple recipients
- Address management and profile integration
- Shipping calculations and method selection
- Database operations with Supabase

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: DO NOT SIMPLIFY THESE COMPONENTS

The following components are **CRITICAL** and should **NEVER** be replaced with simple alternatives:

### 1. Core Components (DO NOT REPLACE)
- `UnifiedCheckoutForm.tsx` - Main checkout orchestrator
- `UnifiedShippingForm.tsx` - Shipping address collection
- `PaymentMethodSelector.tsx` - Payment processing
- `useCheckoutState.tsx` - State management hook
- `orderService.ts` - Order creation and management

### 2. Critical Dependencies
- Stripe integration (`@stripe/react-stripe-js`)
- Supabase edge functions (`create-payment-intent`, `verify-payment-intent`)
- Address service integration
- Profile context integration
- Cart context integration

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem**: Property does not exist on type errors
**Solution**: Check interface definitions, ensure property names match exactly

### Issue: Payment Processing Fails
**Problem**: Payment intent creation or processing fails
**Solution**: 
1. Verify Stripe keys are configured in Supabase secrets
2. Check edge function logs
3. Ensure proper error handling

### Issue: Order Creation Fails
**Problem**: Database insertion errors
**Solution**:
1. Verify all required fields are present
2. Check RLS policies on orders table
3. Ensure user authentication

## üöÄ Quick Restoration Steps

If the checkout system is accidentally simplified/broken:

1. **Restore Core Files**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/checkout/UnifiedCheckoutForm.tsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/checkout/UnifiedShippingForm.tsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/checkout/PaymentMethodSelector.tsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/marketplace/checkout/useCheckoutState.tsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/services/orderService.ts
   ```

2. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Check all imports are present
   - Verify Stripe integration is working
   - Ensure Supabase functions are deployed

3. **Test Critical Paths**:
   - Address form completion
   - Payment processing
   - Order creation
   - Confirmation page navigation

## üîê Security Considerations

- Never expose Stripe secret keys in frontend code
- Always use Supabase edge functions for payment processing
- Maintain proper authentication checks
- Validate all user inputs

## üìä Performance Monitoring

- Monitor edge function execution times
- Track payment success/failure rates
- Watch for database query performance
- Monitor user experience metrics

## üÜò Emergency Contacts

If major issues occur:
1. Check Supabase dashboard for edge function logs
2. Review Stripe dashboard for payment issues
3. Monitor database performance in Supabase
4. Check browser console for frontend errors

**Remember**: This system has been carefully crafted to handle complex e-commerce flows. Resist the urge to simplify - the complexity is necessary for robust functionality.
