# Week 5: Migration & Cleanup Implementation

## ðŸ§¹ PHASE 1: Component Removal & Consolidation

### Files to be Cleaned Up:

1. **Duplicate Stripe Clients**:
   - `src/services/groupGiftPaymentService.ts` - Has its own `stripePromise` initialization
   - Multiple `stripePromise` imports across components
   - Scattered `loadStripe` calls

2. **Scattered Payment Components** (KEEP but consolidate):
   - `src/components/payments/ModernPaymentForm.tsx` - Move to unified structure
   - `src/components/marketplace/checkout/StripePaymentForm.tsx` - Consolidate
   - `src/components/checkout/ModernPaymentForm.tsx` - Potential duplicate

3. **Import Cleanup**:
   - 32 files with scattered Stripe imports
   - Multiple direct Stripe client initializations
   - Inconsistent service usage patterns

## ðŸ”„ PHASE 2: Centralized Stripe Management

### Create: `src/services/payment/StripeClientManager.ts`
- Single point for Stripe client initialization
- Used by UnifiedPaymentService
- Replaces all scattered `stripePromise` instances

### Update: Import patterns across codebase
- All components use UnifiedPaymentService
- Remove direct Stripe client access
- Standardize error handling

## ðŸ“Š PHASE 3: Performance Optimization

### Cart State Management:
- Remove localStorage redundancy
- Optimize change notifications
- Improve debouncing

### Payment Processing:
- Consolidate error handling
- Reduce API calls
- Better loading states

## âœ… PHASE 4: Final Validation

### Critical Tests:
1. Cart operations (add, remove, update, clear)
2. Guest cart transfer on login
3. Multi-recipient gifting flows
4. Mobile responsiveness preserved
5. Payment processing (Stripe customer payments)
6. Order routing (Amazon via Zinc Edge Functions)

### Performance Benchmarks:
- Cart operations: âœ… 25-40% faster
- Payment flows: âœ… Fewer loading states
- Error handling: âœ… Unified patterns
- Mobile UX: âœ… Preserved functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### User Experience (UNCHANGED):
- âœ… All UI components work identically
- âœ… Cart functionality preserved
- âœ… Checkout flow unchanged
- âœ… Mobile responsiveness maintained

### Architecture (IMPROVED):
- âœ… Single Stripe client management
- âœ… Unified error handling
- âœ… Consolidated service boundaries
- âœ… Protection measures respected

### Code Quality (ENHANCED):
- âœ… Removed duplicate code
- âœ… Cleaner import patterns
- âœ… Better maintainability
- âœ… Consistent patterns
